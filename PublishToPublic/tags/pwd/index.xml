      <description>Understanding your location - ($pwd / Get-Location) $pwd is an automatic variable which contains PowerShell&amp;rsquo;s current location. $pwd, which stands for &amp;ldquo;print working directory&amp;rdquo;, and functions like the PowerShell command &amp;ldquo;Get-Location&amp;rdquo;.
You may see me refer to $pwd as &amp;ldquo;Present Working Directory&amp;rdquo; because it also fits the abbreviation and it was always easier for me to remember its function.
VSCode VSCode sets the $pwd (&amp;ldquo;present working directory‚Äù) to the current Workspace location</description>
