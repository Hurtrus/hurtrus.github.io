      <description>We had a select few new users that would have their &amp;lsquo;HomeDrive&amp;rsquo; set to N:\ in Active Directory, but the drive letter would be Z:\ when they logged into their machine.

I scoured the (local and global) GPO&amp;rsquo;s to make absolutely sure that nothing was remapping the HomeDrive.</description>
